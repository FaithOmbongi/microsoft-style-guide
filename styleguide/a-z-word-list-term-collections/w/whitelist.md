# whitelist
Never use *whitelist*. Use *allow list* instead. Note that *allow list* is two words. 

For more specific usage, *safe senders list* can be used. 

**Examples**  
You can use safe senders lists to help with false positives.   
The allow list is a list of digits that will not be blocked by the app.
